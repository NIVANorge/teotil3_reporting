# TEOTIL3 reporting

Each year, NIVA produces an annual "data report" summarising riverine nutrient fluxes simulated using the TEOTIL models. Reports up to and including the year 2022 used data from [TEOTIL2](https://nivanorge.github.io/teotil2/). **From 2023, the annual reports will switch to using results from [TEOTIL3](https://nivanorge.github.io/teotil3/)**, which provides simulations for the period from 2013 onwards. Before 2013, data series for nitrogen and phosphorus will be extended back to 1990 using bias-corrected results from TEOTIL2. The last report based on data from only TEOTIL2 is for 2022 (available [here](https://www.miljodirektoratet.no/publikasjoner/2024/mars-2024/kildefordelte-tilforsler-av-nitrogen-og-fosfor-til-norske-kystomrader-i-2022/)).

Development of TEOTIL3 is described in [NIVA Report 7996-2024](https://niva.brage.unit.no/niva-xmlui/handle/11250/3155374), which includes a comparison between TEOTIL2 and TEOTIL3.

**This repository contains data tables, plots and maps used in TEOTIL3 reports from 2023 onwards**. Data can be either browsed online or downloaded locally for further analysis.

## 1. Report code

Code to generate TEOTIL3 annual reports is [here](https://github.com/NIVANorge/teotil3_reporting/tree/main/code).

## 2. Report data

Data presented in each annual report can the found in the folder `report_data/{year}`, where `year` is the report year. Each annual folder contains subfolders named `plots` and `tables`, which include all the data published in the corresponding annual report. Data can be browsed using the GitHub web interface or downloaded using the `Download raw file` button (located towards the top-right of the file preview window).

The list below provides direct links to the data for each annual report:
